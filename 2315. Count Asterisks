You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        c = 0
        star = 0
        for i in s :
            if i == '|' :
                c += 1
            elif i == '*' and c % 2 == 0 :
                star += 1
        return star
