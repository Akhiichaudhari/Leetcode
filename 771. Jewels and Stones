# You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. 
# Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

# Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        j = list(jewels)
        for i in range(len(stones)) :
            for l in j :
                if l == stones[i] :
                    count += 1
        return count
